# Online Store Testing
## Hexlet Learning Project https://hexlet-products-store.vercel.app/
## Description
A user-friendly e-commerce store interface has been developed, enabling seamless product browsing, filtering, and cart additions. The adaptive design ensures a comfortable experience across all devices.

SPA technology eliminates page reloads, providing a smooth shopping experience. Customers can easily navigate the catalog, apply filters, and view products paginatedly. Product cards display the name, rating, discounted and regular prices. Orders can be managed in the cart, and the contents are stored in the browser session.
